##### About me

Inspired by landscape, nature and the effects that the landscape has on today's environment, Charlotte creates both abstract and literal artworks in the form of prints and paintings that challenge the viewer to think about what is being painted and the tactile nature of the painting process. With a sensitivity to space, perspective and colour, she uses various materials to create these works.

Charlotte was born in 1988 and graduated in Drawing and Painting from Edinburgh College of Art in 2010.
